    /* We are doing this because the label and input box are actually next to each other. 
    However I have set the width of the input boxes to 100% which pushes them to the next line. 
    So its not like two elements are stacked one on top of the otber but the two elements are 
    actually next to each other but the second element (input box)  is just pushed to the next line. 
    Hence used line height instead of margin. As line height will apply to lines in paragraph 
    where as margin is between elements.*/
