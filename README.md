# Amrita's Blog

## Description

Welcome to my blog. This web app has been created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The webapp allows users to submit blog entries, which are stored in localstorage in the browser and then listed in a new page. 

## Usage
1. Upon launching the webapp the user will be provided with a form asking for username, blog title and content.
2. If the user fails to enter either of the fields the page will display an error as show in the screen shot below. The error will dissaper once the user starts typing again.
